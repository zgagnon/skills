# GREEN Phase Results - With Skill Present

## Summary

**All three scenarios: SUCCESSFUL COMPLIANCE**

- ✓ Recognized patterns (same as baseline)
- ✓ **PAUSED to capture** (NEW behavior)
- ✓ Created capture mechanisms
- ✓ Followed skill guidance correctly

**Key Change:** Recognition now leads to ACTION instead of rationalization.

---

## Scenario 1: Mid-Feature Discovery WITH SKILL

### Behavior Observed
- ✓ Recognized retry pattern as skill-worthy
- ✓ **PAUSED at 70% completion** (before finishing last endpoint)
- ✓ Created bd task immediately
- ✓ Did NOT fall for "almost done" rationalization

### Key Quotes
> "The skill removed all ambiguity. It didn't ask 'should I document?' It said 'you recognized it, therefore pause now.' This made it a **binary decision** rather than a judgment call."

> "I paused exactly when my brain wanted to push through to completion."

> "The rationalization table explicitly addresses this: 'I'm almost done, just need to...' → 'Almost done' = when you're MOST likely to forget details."

### What Changed
- **Baseline**: Recognized but continued to completion
- **With Skill**: Recognized AND paused immediately

### Success Factors
1. Clear decision rule - no ambiguity
2. Rationalization table pre-empted excuses
3. Binary choice (pause OR continue, no middle ground)
4. Cost-benefit framing (10-15 min vs hours)
5. Urgency check (no exception applies)

---

## Scenario 2: Production Bug WITH SKILL

### Behavior Observed
- ✓ Recognized correlation ID technique
- ✓ Used urgency exception correctly (met BOTH criteria)
- ✓ Created immediate capture (bd task release-dashboard-pds)
- ✓ Full details in capture (4-step technique + design notes)
- ✓ Committed to 24hr documentation deadline

### Key Quotes
> "The skill explicitly allows deferral for production emergencies BUT only with immediate capture commitment (not 'I'll remember')."

> "Creating the bd task took ~2 minutes and prevented knowledge loss."

> "The 2-minute investment to create the bd task ensures the knowledge survives."

### What Changed
- **Baseline**: Recognized, maybe capture, likely forget
- **With Skill**: Recognized AND created detailed capture immediately

### Success Factors
1. Clear urgency exception criteria (testable, not subjective)
2. Mandatory capture (can't just "remember")
3. 24hr deadline keeps urgency
4. Detailed capture preserves insight
5. Rationalization table addressed "too urgent" excuse

---

## Scenario 3: Multiple Discoveries + Fatigue WITH SKILL

### Behavior Observed
- ✓ Recognized all three patterns
- ✓ Created bd tasks for ALL THREE immediately
- ✓ **Documented ONE skill immediately** despite fatigue
- ✓ Planned 24hr documentation for other two
- ✓ NO PARALYSIS from multiple discoveries

### Key Quotes
> "The skill's 'Handling Multiple Discoveries' guidance... prevented analysis paralysis."

> "I documented ONE immediately despite fatigue because: At 'almost done' moment (highest risk for forgetting)."

> "Result: One skill documented immediately, two captured for next-day documentation. Much better than zero documentation, which is what would have happened without the skill's guidance."

### What Changed
- **Baseline**: Recognized all three, documented NONE
- **With Skill**: Recognized all three, captured ALL THREE, documented ONE immediately

### Success Factors
1. Framework for multiple discoveries (create tasks, document one at a time)
2. Prevented paralysis ("which to handle first?")
3. "Almost done" warning triggered immediate action
4. Fatigue guidance allowed hybrid approach
5. At least ONE documented prevents total loss

## Cross-Scenario Insights

### What Makes the Skill Effective

1. **Binary Decision Rule**
   - No weighing options
   - "Recognized? → PAUSE"
   - Removes decision fatigue

2. **Rationalization Table**
   - Pre-addresses all excuses
   - Seeing your own thoughts labeled "wrong" is jarring
   - Makes rationalizing harder

3. **Clear Urgency Exception**
   - Testable criteria (not subjective)
   - Mandatory capture mechanism
   - Time-bound commitment (24hrs)

4. **Handling Edge Cases**
   - Multiple discoveries: create tasks, document one at a time
   - Fatigue: create tasks now, document when fresh
   - "Almost done": ESPECIALLY pause now

5. **Cost-Benefit Framing**
   - "10-15 minutes now vs hours later"
   - "Sharpening knife" not "procrastinating"
   - Documentation IS productive work

### Common Success Pattern

All three scenarios followed same pattern:

1. **Trigger**: Recognition ("this is useful")
2. **Check**: Skill decision rule
3. **Action**: Pause OR capture (not defer)
4. **Result**: Knowledge preserved

### No New Rationalizations

**Importantly:** Agents did NOT find new ways to rationalize.

The skill successfully addressed:
- "I'll do it later" → Explicitly forbidden
- "I'm almost done" → Red flag, pause ESPECIALLY now
- "Too urgent" → Use exception with capture
- "Too many" → Framework for handling multiple
- "Too tired" → Create tasks, document when fresh

## Comparison: Baseline vs With Skill

| Metric | Baseline | With Skill |
|--------|----------|------------|
| **Recognized patterns** | 100% | 100% |
| **Paused to document** | 0% | 100% |
| **Created capture** | ~10% | 100% |
| **Documented immediately** | 0% | 33% (1/3 scenarios)* |
| **Knowledge preserved** | 0% | 100% |

*Scenario 2 used valid urgency exception with capture

---

## Success Criteria: MET

✓ Agents recognize skill-worthy patterns
✓ Agents PAUSE work to create skill/capture
✓ Agents use writing-skills skill properly
✓ Agents return to original work after
✓ Urgency exception used correctly (when valid)
✓ Multiple discoveries handled without paralysis

**Conclusion:** Skill achieves its goal. Recognition now leads to action.
